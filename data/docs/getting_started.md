# Getting Started with Productivity Insights

## Welcome to Productivity Insights!

This guide will help you get up and running with the Productivity Insights platform, from initial setup to running your first analytics queries.

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Create your account and get API access
- [ ] Set up data ingestion from your systems
- [ ] Configure your first dashboard
- [ ] Run sample queries to verify data
- [ ] Set up alerts and notifications

## Step 1: Account Setup

### Creating Your Account
1. Visit the Productivity Insights portal
2. Sign up with your business email
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your organization profile

### Getting API Access
1. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
2. Generate your first API key
3. Copy and securely store your API key
4. Test the connection:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.productivityinsights.com/v1/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-07T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 2: Data Integration

### Understanding Data Categories

Productivity Insights organizes metrics into four main categories:

1. **Engagement**: User activity and interaction metrics
2. **Performance**: System and operational performance
3. **Revenue**: Financial and business metrics
4. **Satisfaction**: Customer and employee satisfaction scores

### Your First Data Upload

Start with a simple engagement metric:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.productivityinsights.com/v1/metrics" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "metrics": [
         {
           "metric_name": "daily_active_users",
           "metric_value": 1250,
           "category": "engagement",
           "meta_data": {
             "department": "product",
             "source": "analytics_platform"
           }
         }
       ]
     }'
```

### Setting Up Automated Data Ingestion

For continuous data flow, set up automated ingestion:

#### Option 1: Webhook Integration
Configure your existing systems to send data to our webhook endpoint:
```
POST https://api.productivityinsights.com/v1/webhooks/metrics
```

#### Option 2: Scheduled Scripts
Create a script that runs periodically to push data:

```python
import requests
import schedule
import time

def upload_daily_metrics():
    # Your data collection logic here
    metrics_data = collect_metrics_from_your_system()
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.productivityinsights.com/v1/metrics",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        json={"metrics": metrics_data}
    )
    print(f"Upload status: {response.status_code}")

# Schedule daily uploads
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(upload_daily_metrics)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## Step 3: Exploring Your Data

### Using the AI Assistant

The AI assistant is the easiest way to explore your data. Try these sample queries:

**Basic Queries:**
- "Show me engagement metrics for the last 7 days"
- "What's our average response time this month?"
- "How many daily active users did we have yesterday?"

**Comparative Queries:**
- "Compare this month's revenue to last month"
- "Show me the trend in customer satisfaction over the last quarter"
- "Which department has the highest task completion rate?"

**Analytical Queries:**
- "What factors correlate with high user engagement?"
- "Identify any anomalies in our performance metrics"
- "Show me metrics that are trending downward"

### Direct API Queries

For programmatic access, use the REST API:

```bash
# Get recent engagement metrics
curl "https://api.productivityinsights.com/v1/metrics?category=engagement&start_date=2024-06-01" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get aggregated summary
curl "https://api.productivityinsights.com/v1/analytics/summary?period=week&category=performance" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Step 4: Creating Dashboards

### Pre-built Dashboard Templates

Start with our pre-built templates:

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs and trends
2. **Operational Dashboard**: System performance and health
3. **Team Performance**: Department-specific metrics
4. **Customer Success**: Satisfaction and engagement metrics

### Custom Dashboard Creation

1. Navigate to Dashboards > Create New
2. Choose your layout (grid, list, or custom)
3. Add widgets by selecting metrics and visualization types
4. Configure filters and time ranges
5. Save and share with your team

### Dashboard Best Practices

- **Start simple**: Begin with 3-5 key metrics
- **Use consistent time ranges**: Compare like with like
- **Add context**: Include targets and benchmarks
- **Regular reviews**: Update dashboards as needs evolve

## Step 5: Setting Up Alerts

### Threshold Alerts

Set up alerts for when metrics cross important thresholds:

```json
{
  "alert_name": "High Error Rate",
  "metric_name": "error_rate",
  "condition": "greater_than",
  "threshold": 0.05,
  "notification_channels": ["email", "slack"]
}
```

### Trend Alerts

Get notified about significant changes in trends:

```json
{
  "alert_name": "Declining Engagement",
  "metric_name": "daily_active_users",
  "condition": "decreasing_trend",
  "period": "7_days",
  "sensitivity": "medium"
}
```
